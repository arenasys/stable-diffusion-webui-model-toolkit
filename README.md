Install by: `Extenstions tab > Install from URL > Paste in this pages URL > Install`

## Features
- Cleaning/pruning models.
- Converting to/from safetensors.
- Extracting/replacing model components.
- Identifying/debugging model architectures.

# Example
Many models being distributed are quite bloated, most of their size being redundant or useless data.

For example, Anything-v3.0 is 7.7gb and requires a separate 800mb VAE. These can be combined and cleaned into a **2.1gb standalone model**, with the correct VAE included.

Easy way, replace the VAE directly:
```
1. Select Anything-v3.0.ckpt from the source dropdown, press Load.
2. Change to the Advanced tab.
3. Select the class VAE-v1 and leave the component on auto
4. Select Anything-v3.0.vae.ckpt from the import dropdown, press Import.
5. Change the model name to something appropriate like Anything-v3.0.safetensors
6. Press Save.
```

Hard way, build the model from components:
```
1. Select Anything-v3.0.ckpt from the dropdown, press Load.
2. Change to the Advanced tab.
3. Select the class CLIP-v1, press Export.
4. Select the class UNET-v1, press Export.
5. Press Clear
6. Select NEW SDv1 from the source dropdown, press Load.
7. Select the class CLIP-v1, and select the Anything-v3 CLIP (just exported), press Import.
8. Select the class UNET-v1, and select the Anything-v3 UNET (just exported), press Import.
9. Select the class VAE-v1, and select the Anything-v3 VAE, press Import.
10. Change the model name to something appropriate like Anything-v3.0.safetensors
11. Press Save.
```

## Advanced
The advanced tab lets you replace and extract model components, it also shows the detailed report. Import can extract components from full models, so if you want to replace the CLIP in your model with the SD 1.4 CLIP then you can simply specify the CLIP component and import the SD 1.4 checkpoint. The report will show all matched architectures, all rejected architectures (and reasons why they were rejected), and the list of all unknown keys. This is mostly useful for debuging models to see why they wont load.

## Autopruning
Toggle the `Enable Autopruning` option in settings. On startup of the WebUI everything in the `models/Autoprune` folder will be pruned into FP16 `.safetensor` models (except VAEs which will be `.pt`) and moved into their proper folders. Broken or unknown models will be skipped. Models will be renamed if there is a conflict when moving (`NAI.safetensors` to `NAI(1).safetensors`, etc). The `Reload UI` button will also trigger the Autopruning.

## Metric
During analysis a metric is computed which attempts to uniquely identify a models weights. The AnythingV3 model produced above has the metric: `(2020/2982/0130)`, which corresponds to `(UNET/VAE/CLIP)`. This toolkit knows the metrics for a few common components and will include any matches in its report. So for `(2020/2982/0130)` it knows the VAE metric of `2982` corresponds to the NAI VAE and will report `Uses the NAI VAE`. Actually many VAEs being distributed are just NAI VAE renamed, without a metric it would be difficult to know. Though this system isnt foolproof and incorrect matches can happen.

## Notes
Some things that may be useful to know when manipulating models.

### Components
Stable Diffusion requires 3 different components to function: the VAE, the UNET and CLIP. Checkpoints contain all these components. The toolkit can still recognize checkpoints that are missing components, but they wont be considered intact. For example a checkpoint thats missing its CLIP will be recognized as containing the `UNET-v1-BROKEN` and the `VAE-v1-BROKEN` models, which can be exported like normal if you want to fix the model. Any checkpoint under 2gb will be missing a component (or multiple).

**The WebUI expects a checkpoint to contain all of these components, if one is missing then it will continue using whatever was last loaded (unless you load it first, then its left uninitialized and you will see NaN related errors).**

### Precision
Comparison between the 2.1gb model and the orginal 8.5gb model.
**By default the webui will cast all loaded models to FP16**. Without `--no-half` the models will be exactly identical.
Shown is a comparison with `--no-half` enabled.

But which is FP16 and which is FP32?

### EMA
EMA data is stored to enable finetuning to stop and start as needed without losing momentum. Upload the original checkpoint output by the trainer if you want people to effectively use the EMA data.

After merging, the EMA no longer accurately reflects the UNET and will be a detriment to training.

The EMA data is itself an independant and functional UNET. You can export the `UNET-v1-EMA` component to extract the EMA unet, then replace the regular UNET with it. For example the EMA UNET vs normal UNET in AnythingV3.

### CLIP
During merging a CLIP key called `embeddings.position_ids` is sometimes broken. This is an int64 tensor that has the values from 0 to 76, merging will convert these to float and introduce errors. For example in AnythingV3 the value `76` has become `75.9975`, which is cast back to int64 when loaded by the webui, resulting in `75`. The option `Fix broken CLIP position IDs` (in settings) will fix this tensor, this is off by default because it changes the model output slightly. Fixed vs Broken.

### VAE
The UNET somehow takes to merging quite well, but thats not the case for the VAE. Any merge between different VAE's will result in something broken.
This is why the VAE in the AnythingV3 checkpoint produces horrible outputs, and why people have resorted to distributing and loading the VAE seperatly. 

But replacing the VAE is not a perfect solution. UNETs operate inside the latent space produced by the VAE. We dont know the effect merging has on the latent space the UNET is expecting, theres no reason it would interpolate with the weights. Luckily VAEs produce very similar latent spaces (by design), so in practice using one of the original VAEs will do a decent job.

The effect of merging on CLIP is currently unknown to me, but evidentily its not so devistating.
